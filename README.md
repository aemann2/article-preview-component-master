# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component [https://jovial-darwin-359719.netlify.app/]

## Background

Another card-based challenge. I struggled a bit on getting the photo to work within the dimensions of the card...it probably would have been easier if I had set the photo as a `background-image` of the `div` instead of putting the photo directly in the `html`. The Javascript was simple and I enjoyed it, and making it responsive was also pretty straightforward.
